# refinement-detector.sh - Detect skill refinement opportunities from user prompts
#
# This hook listens for keywords indicating the user wants to refine a skill.
# When detected, it suggests running `npx @rhize/skill-forge refine`.
#
# Installation:
#   Add to your .claude/settings.json hooks section:
#   {
#     "hooks": {
#       "user_prompt_submit": "<path-to-this-file>/refinement-detector.sh"
#     }
#   }
#
# Note: skill refinement now ships as `skill-forge refine` in the @rhize/skill-forge
# npm package — the rhize-meta plugin is retired.
#
# Usage:
#   This hook is triggered automatically on user prompt submission.
#   It reads the prompt from stdin.

set -e

# Read the prompt from stdin
PROMPT=""
while IFS= read -r line; do
    PROMPT="$PROMPT$line"
done

# Convert to lowercase for matching
PROMPT_LOWER=$(echo "$PROMPT" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')

# Keywords that indicate refinement opportunity
REFINEMENT_KEYWORDS=(
    "skill doesn't work"
    "skill doesnt work"
    "skill should have"
    "missing trigger"

    "why didnt skill"
    "skill broke"

    "hook doesn't"

    if echo "$PROMPT_LOWER" | grep -qF "$keyword"; then
        MATCHED="$keyword"
        break
    fi
done

# If a refinement keyword was found, output suggestion

💡 Skill Refinement Opportunity Detected
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

It looks like you've encountered an issue with a skill.
Would you like to capture this as a refinement?

Run: npx @rhize/skill-forge refine

This will help:
  • Document the expected vs actual behavior
  • Create a project-specific override
  • Track the pattern for potential generalization
