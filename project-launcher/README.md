# Project Launcher Plugin

End-to-end project launcher for Rhize Media. Takes a project idea from napkin sketch through research, PRD generation, critical gap analysis, project scaffolding, and GSD v2 handoff for autonomous development.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/launch-project` | Full 6-phase pipeline: research → PRD → gap analysis → scaffold → GSD handoff |
| `/write-prd` | Phases 1-4: research → interview → PRD → gap analysis |
| `/scaffold-gsd` | Phases 5-6: create project directory + GSD v2 handoff from existing PRD |
| `/grill-prd` | Phase 4 standalone: critical gap analysis of an existing PRD |

## Skills

| Skill | Trigger |
|-------|---------|
| `project-launcher` | "start a new project", "create a PRD", "scaffold for GSD", "prepare for autonomous dev" |

## Commands & Execution Flags

| Command/Flag | Phase(s) | Purpose |

| `/sc:reflect` | Post-phase | Validate task implementation |
| `/simplify` | Post-phase | Review and simplify code |

## Hooks

| Hook | Matcher | Behavior |
|------|---------|----------|
| **SessionStart** | All sessions | Loads command menu and integrations list into context |
| **PreToolUse** | `Write\|Edit` on launcher artifacts | When writing PRDs, requirements, research docs, context files, discovery notes, or roadmaps — and an Obsidian vault exists at `~/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/Obsidian Vault` — nudges Claude to also save the artifact to the vault using second-brain methodology: `[[wikilinks]]` to related projects, `#tags` in frontmatter, parent MOC links, and placement under the appropriate `Projects/` folder. If no vault exists, the hook stays silent. |

Hooks fail silently on error (3-5s timeout) and never block operations. The vault detection is path-based — no external tools required.

**Artifact detection patterns** (path or content): `prd`, `requirements`, `research`, `context`, `gap-analysis`, `interview`, `discovery`, `roadmap`, `project.md`, `requirements.md`, plus content headings like `## PRD`, `## Requirements`, `# Product Requirements`.

## Post-Phase Verification Pattern

After each GSD phase, the autonomous Claude runs:
```
/sc:reflect on whether all tasks were implemented and then /simplify your code changes where needed for an optimal solution
```
