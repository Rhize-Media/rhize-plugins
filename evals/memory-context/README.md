# Memory-context deterministic evaluation

The paired fixture is fed to the same host-neutral runner for Claude Code and Codex. Tests freeze
the timestamp and assert byte-equivalent manifests, conflict preservation, inert untrusted content,
scope denial, unavailable adapters, TTL, source revision invalidation, and exact-source purge.

This corpus is deterministic contract evidence only. It is not operational retrieval evidence and
must not be pooled with later host/model task outcomes.

```bash
python3 -m pytest -q evals/memory-context/tests
